# Basic-Input-Output-operations

AIM 1:
Write a program to print hello world

THEORY:
This simple C++ program demonstrates how to print "Hello World" to the console.
In C++, the `iostream` library is used to handle input and output operations. The `cout` object, part of the `iostream` library, is used to print data to the console. To print "Hello World," we use the `<<` operator to insert the string "Hello World" into the `cout` stream, and then we flush the stream to display the text on the console.


ALGORITHM:
1.#include : This line includes the Input/Output Stream library, which provides functions like cout and endl for input and output operations.

2.int main() { ... }: This is the main function of your C++ program. It is the entry point of your program, and execution begins here.

3.std::cout: This is the standard C++ output stream, which is used to display output on the console.

4."Hello, World!": This is the text you want to print. It is enclosed in double quotation marks to represent a string.

5.<<: This is the output stream operator, used to insert the string "Hello, World!" into the std::cout stream.

6.std::endl: This is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer. It ensures that "Hello, World!" is displayed on a new line.

7.return 0;: This line indicates the successful completion of the main function. In C++, it's a convention to return 0 to indicate a successful execution of the program.

8.Compile and run this code, and it will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
